# Power BI Final Assignment (Workearly)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three sheets:

1) Quality Data: Contains information about tasks performed, including the Date, Employee ID (Emp ID), Auditor ID, Total Tasks, Samples, Defects, and Fatal Errors for each task.
2) EMP Master: Provides details about employees, including Employee ID (Emp ID), Employee Name (EMP Name), Supervisor, and Work Location.
3) Auditors: Includes Auditor ID and Auditor Name, linking auditors to the tasks they have audited.
These sheets together provide a comprehensive overview of task performance, quality metrics, and employee and auditor information.

## Exercise
This project consists of various exercises focused on creating and visualizing key metrics in Power BI. It involves calculating percentages (such as Sampling%, Defects%, and Fatal Errors%), creating different types of charts like Card, Gauge, and Clustered Bar charts, and utilizing visual elements such as background images and map charts. The exercises guide you through creating dashboards and tooltips, visualizing data by Supervisor, Work Location, and EMP Name, and using critical thinking to display employee performance effectively.
